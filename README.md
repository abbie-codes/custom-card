# custom-card
A customizable payment card website created for Code First Girls Web Development Final Project 

This website includes a minimalistic landing page, and a page that let's you build a payment card & input your personal details. 

I have used buttons to navigate through the site and div's that are set to display "block" or display "none" so that you never navigate away from the HTML build page. 
I have also included a pop up order confirmation feature that only appears when you click order.

I have created a slideshow of different card designs on the landing page using JS. 

I have also created a 'Preview' section on the build page, so you can preview the card with the options you have selected. 

All images used on the cards were found on Pexels, and I used photoshop to create the payment cards. The logo and order confirmation illustrations were purchased from Ouch (Part of Icons8). 

I have used HTML, CSS and JS for this project.
